# Melanoma_Cancer_Detection
Melanoma is a serious type of skin cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It develops in the cells (melanocytes) that produce melanin - the pigment that gives your skin its color. Melanoma can also form in your eyes and, rarely, inside your body, such as in your nose or throat.


## Problem statement
To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution which can evaluate images and alert the dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

## Project Pipeline
* Reading and understanding the data
* Dataset creation
* Dataset Visualization
* Building and Training 1st Model 
* Findings from 1st Model - overfitting
* Adding Data Augmentation Strategy to resolve issue observed in 1st Model
* Building and Training 2nd Model 
* Findings from 2nd Model - underfitting due to class imbalance
* Examining Class distribution
* Handling class imbalance - using Augmentor library
* Building and Training final Model 
* Analyzing results

## Conclusion
- Training and validation accuracy increased in final model
- Model overfitting and underfitting issues are resolved
- Class rebalance helped in augmentation and achieving the best Training and validation accuracy
